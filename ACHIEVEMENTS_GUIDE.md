## 🦈 1. Pull Shark

**Requirement:** Merge Pull Requests.

- **Bronze:** Merge 2 PRs.
- **Silver:** Merge 16 PRs.
- **Gold:** Merge 128 PRs.

**Strategy:**
Don't spam! Fix typos in documentation, add small features to open source repos, or use our [Speedrun Repo](https://github.com/LuisSambrano/github-achievements-speedrun) to practice valid PRs.

## 🤠 2. Quickdraw

**Requirement:** Close an issue or merge a PR within 5 minutes of it being opened.
**Strategy:**

1. Open an issue on your own repo.
2. Fix it immediately.
3. Close it. (Speed is key!)

## 🚀 3. YOLO

**Requirement:** Merge a Pull Request without code review.
**Strategy:**

1. Create a branch.
2. Make a change.
3. Merge it to `main` immediately (Admin overrides often trigger this).
   _Warning: Don't do this on critical production apps!_

## 🧠 4. Galaxy Brain

**Requirement:** Get accepted answers in GitHub Discussions.

- **Bronze:** 2 Answers.
- **Silver:** 8 Answers.
- **Gold:** 16 Answers.

**Strategy:**
Find repositories with active "Discussions" tabs. Look for "Q&A" categories. Answer questions helpfully.

## 👯 5. Pair Extraordinaire

**Requirement:** Co-author commits.
**Strategy:**
When committing, add this formatting to your commit message:

```
Co-authored-by: Name <email@example.com>
```

## 🌟 6. Starstruck (Rare & Free)

**Requirement:** Create a repository that gets 16 stars.
**Strategy:**

1.  Build something useful (like this Badge Scanner!).
2.  Share it on Twitter/LinkedIn.
3.  Add the `hacktoberfest` topic if applicable.
4.  **Pro Tip:** Ask friends to star your repo. It counts!

## 💖 7. Public Sponsor (The "Heart" Badge)

**Requirement:** Sponsor an open source developer.
**Strategy:**

1.  Find a developer you admire who has GitHub Sponsors enabled.
2.  Sponsor them for just **$1** (one-time).
3.  The badge appears on your profile immediately.
4.  _Technically not free, but $1 is cheaper than GitHub Pro ($4/mo)._
