This is the official tool used in the **[GitHub Achievements Speedrun](https://github.com/LuisSambrano/github-achievements-speedrun)** guide.

It connects to your GitHub profile to verify unlocked hidden achievements (Quickdraw, YOLO, Pull Shark, etc.) and calculate your progress towards the next tier.
